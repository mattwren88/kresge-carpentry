# Kresge Carpentry starter site

Static single-page starter using only HTML, CSS, and a little vanilla JS. No frameworks or build tools required.

## File structure
- `index.html` – main page with sections for hero, services, projects, process, testimonials, and contact.
- `assets/css/styles.css` – global styles and layout.
- `assets/js/main.js` – mobile nav toggle and smooth scrolling.
- `assets/images/` – place photos or logos here as you add them.

## Run locally
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000`) for clean relative URLs.

## Quick customization
- Swap in real phone/email in `index.html` (`tel:` and `mailto:` links).
- Update service descriptions, testimonials, and service area text.
- Drop project photos into `assets/images/` and replace the gradient placeholders in the “Recent projects” section.
