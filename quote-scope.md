# Kresge Carpentry LLC — Website Scope & Estimate

Below is the proposed scope for building a new marketing site that captures your Facebook presence and turns it into a professional, high-performing web experience. Items are grouped so we can mix and match if needed.

## 1. Strategy & Content Alignment
- Kickoff call to define goals, service priorities, service areas, and desired lead flow.
- Content audit of existing Facebook posts/photos to select testimonials, project highlights, and process language.
- Copywriting + light editing for hero, services, project blurbs, process steps, testimonials, and contact CTAs (up to two revision rounds).

## 2. Design System & Layout
- Custom single-page layout (hero, services, recent work, process, testimonials, gallery, contact, footer).
- Color palette inspired by the current logo/wood tones, typography pairing, button + badge system.
- Hi-fi responsive mockups (desktop + mobile) with one revision cycle.

## 3. Front-End Build
- Hand-coded HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS (no frameworks) using semantic markup and accessibility best practices.
- Responsive grid system, sticky mobile navigation, smooth scrolling, animation timing, and body scroll locking.
- Integration of logo + image assets; CTA buttons linking to phone, email, and Facebook.

## 4. Asset Preparation & Performance
- Download/prepare up to eight project photos from Facebook, convert to optimized WebP + JPEG fallbacks.
- Lazy loading, `<picture>` usage, explicit dimensions, and non-blocking stylesheets to hit strong Lighthouse scores.
- Basic favicon/app icon set.

## 5. SEO & Schema Enhancements
- Meta tags (title, description, OpenGraph/Twitter), canonical URL, theme color.
- Structured data: LocalBusiness + FAQ schema with key service details.
- Sitemap.xml and robots.txt generation (optional add-on).

## 6. Contact & Lead Capture
- Accessible contact form with validation-ready markup (tied to Formspree/Basin/Netlify Forms or another service once selected).
- `mailto:` and `tel:` fallbacks to ensure leads can reach you even before a form service is configured.

## 7. Deployment & Handoff
- Hosting setup on Netlify, Vercel, Render, or preferred static host (includes environment configuration and deploy previews).
- Domain connection support (DNS updates, SSL configuration).
- Final QA across modern browsers + mobile devices; deliverable handoff with README and update instructions.

## Optional Ongoing Services
- Quarterly content refresh (new photos, testimonials, service updates).
- Performance monitoring + analytics reporting.
- Priority support for small tweaks or seasonal promos.

> **Next Step:** Pick the sections you need, and we’ll assign a trade value in carpentry hours or materials to keep the “work for work” arrangement balanced. Once scope is locked, we can schedule kickoff and get their future clients off Facebook-only browsing.
